# Relations

Relations are more general than functions. The key difference is that the same element in the Domain may be related to multiple elements in the Co-domain

## Inverse of a Relation

$ùêë^{-1} = { (y,x) \in B\times A | (x,y) \in R }.$

For all $x \in A$ and $y \in B$, $(y,x) \in R_{-1}\iff (x,y) \in R$.

What this means is visualized in the following diagram:

In this case, the second diagram is an inverse of the first.

## Finite sets and directed graphs

A directed graph displays the relations inside a finite set. What we see is that from $A = {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}$ -  we created the three sets $(4, 7)(2)(3,6,9)$

## Equivalence relations

An equivalence relation is only one if the three following conditions are fulfilled:

### Reflexivity



### Symmetry

### Transitivity

# Congruences

# Modular arithmetic

## Inverse modulo n

## Bezout's theorem

## Example: Ceasar cipher

## RSA cryptography
