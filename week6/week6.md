# Graphs

Graphs are a powerful problem-solving tool because they enable us to represent a complex situation with a single image that can be analyzed both visually and with the aid of a computer

## Terminology of graphs

- Graph: The whole drawing
- Parallell edges: 2 edges connecting to each other
- Isolated vertex: No edges connected
- Adjaceny: 2 connected edges
- Degree: Number of edges that start or end at a vertex
