# Sequences

A sequence is a function whose domain is either all the intergers between two given intergers or all the integers greater than or equal to a given integer. The equence is typically represented as a set of elements written in a row $a_{m}, a_{m+1}, a_{m+2},..., a_{n}$, where each individual element $a_{k}$ is called a term. The $k$ is called subscript or index.

## Geometric sequence

A Sequence is only called an geometric sequence if and if only there is a constant $r$ such that

$a_{k} = a_{k-1} * r$

## Arithmetic sequence

A Sequence is only called an arithmetic sequence if and if only there is a constant $d$ such that

$a_{k} = a_{k-1} + d$


# Mathematical induction

4 step plan for solving induction problems:

1. Identify base case
2. Set up induction hypothesis
3. Prove hypothesis (if true) with induction step
4. Conclude

## Example: Sum of first n integers

$1 + 2 + ... + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ for all integers $n \geq 1$

Base case: $ P(1) = \frac{1(1+1)}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1$

Inductive hypothesis: "$P(k) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$ is true"

Inductive step: $P(k+1) = \frac{k+1((k+1)+1)}{2} = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}$
